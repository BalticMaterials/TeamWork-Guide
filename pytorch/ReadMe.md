### Start Coding with Poetry basic pyproject.toml
the example_pyproject.toml is storing the primarly used and checked basic configuration for:

sphinx      -> https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/
black       -> https://github.com/psf/black
numpy       -> https://numpy.org/
pytorch     -> https://pytorch.org/
and python  -> https://www.python.org/

They are used as the base for all coding work and project. If there are relevant changes from this principle read the ReadMe.md in the main directors.
